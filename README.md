A Next 13, fully responsive portfolio for a cat DJ, named DJ Cat Paws. Built to be different and creative, it features creative design, a music player, animations, and much more!

Although it is a showcase project, it is built with scalability in mind. Featuring Sanity for content management, along with a custom desk setup, it features a fully functional blog, pricing section and the ability to expand it further.

This project was a lovely opportunity to experiment further not only with Sanity, but also with building a creative UI with quite a few animations.

Regarding the tooling, React Server Components, TypeScript, Framer Motion, Tailwind, and ShadCn are used among others. For a detailed overview, please have a look at the [**Features**](#features) & [**Tech**](#tech) section.
